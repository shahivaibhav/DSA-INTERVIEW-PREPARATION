Leetcode 208:- Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)(Medium)

Detailed Explanation:
TrieNode Class:

The TrieNode class represents a single node in the Trie. Each node can have up to 26 children, one for each letter of the alphabet ('a' to 'z').
children[26]: An array of pointers to represent the children nodes. Each element corresponds to a character index ('a' maps to index 0, 'b' maps to 1, etc.).
isEnd: A boolean flag indicating whether a word ends at this node. This helps distinguish between words and prefixes.

Trie Class:

insert(string word):

Inserts a word into the Trie. For each character in the word, it traverses through the corresponding child node. If the child node is missing, it creates a new TrieNode.
Finally, it marks the last node as the end of the word using the isEnd flag.
search(string word):

Searches for a word in the Trie by traversing the nodes according to the characters in the word.
If a node corresponding to any character is missing, it returns false.
If all characters are found and the last node is marked as a word end (isEnd == true), it returns true.
startsWith(string prefix):

Checks if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix.
Similar to search, but it does not require the last node to be marked as a word end.
Time Complexity Analysis:
insert(string word):

Each insertion operation involves traversing the word length, l.
For each character, a constant-time operation is performed (checking and setting child pointers).
Time Complexity: 

O(l).
search(string word):

Each search operation involves traversing the word length, l.
For each character, a constant-time operation is performed (checking child pointers).

Time Complexity: 
O(l).
startsWith(string prefix):

Each operation involves traversing the prefix length, p.
For each character, a constant-time operation is performed (checking child pointers).

Time Complexity: 
O(p).


Space Complexity Analysis:

Space Usage for Trie Nodes:

Each node uses 26 pointers for children (TrieNode* children[26]).
Space complexity depends on the number of distinct characters inserted into the Trie.
Total Space Complexity:

For a given set of words, let L be the total length of all words.
Each character in L may need a separate node.
Space Complexity: 

O(26Ã—L) = O(L).
